                        <p>
                            Ghost Players are a new feature that introduces the ability to live after death, although in a downgraded state. Whenever a player dies, a skeleton spawns at their death point. Their inventory is dropped, and they become a ghost. Upon death, WX-78 also loses their upgrades. Ghosts can Haunt items and structures, possibly setting objects on fire, or affecting them in some other way.
